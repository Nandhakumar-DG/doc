# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **GitHub in less than 5 minutes**.

## Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that helps developers store code, track changes, and collaborate on projects using Git, a version control system. It is widely used in software development, open-source projects, and team collaboration.

### Repositories
A repository (repo) is the central place where a project is stored on GitHub.
It contains source code, files, folders, and the complete history of changes made to the project.
Repositories help developers organize projects, track versions, and collaborate with others.
### Branches
A branch is a separate version of a repository that allows developers to work on changes without affecting the main codebase.
Branches are commonly used to develop new features, fix bugs, or test ideas safely.
### Commits
A commit is a saved snapshot of changes made to files in a repository.
Each commit records what was changed, who made the change, and when it was made, along with a short message describing the update.
### Pull Requests
A Pull Request (PR) is a way to propose changes made in a branch and request that they be merged into another branch, usually the main branch.
Pull requests allow team members to review code, discuss improvements, and suggest changes before merging.
### Issues
Issues are used to track bugs, tasks, enhancements, and feature requests in a GitHub repository.
They provide a place for team members to report problems, discuss ideas, and plan work.
### Actions
GitHub Actions is a feature that allows you to automate workflows directly in a repository.
It is commonly used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), such as automatically building, testing, and deploying code.
### Security & Access Control
Security & Access Control in GitHub help protect repositories and manage who can view or modify them.
GitHub allows repository owners to assign roles and permissions (read, write, admin) to users and teams.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
