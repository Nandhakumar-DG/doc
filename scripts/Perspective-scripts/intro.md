# Ignition Perspective Scripts Overview

View scripts in Ignition Perspective are Python scripts that execute in response to events within a View (Perspective's equivalent of a "screen"). These scripts run in the session scope and enable interactive, user-driven functionality in your HMI applications.

## Types of View Event Scripts

### Session-Scoped Execution
View scripts run within individual user sessions in the browser or mobile app, not on the Gateway. Each session has its own script execution context.

### Event-Driven
Scripts are triggered by user interactions (clicks, inputs) or view lifecycle events (load, unload, property changes).

### Component-Based
Scripts can be attached to individual components (buttons, dropdowns, containers) or to the view itself.

## Getting Started

To learn more about implementing Perspective Scripts, explore the documentation below.
